Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a term increasingly used in the last decade to 
describe a range of systems implemented on full-scale civil infrastructures and whose 
purposes are to assist and inform operators about continued ‘fitness for purpose’ of 
structures under gradual or sudden changes to their state, to learn about either or both 
of the load and response mechanisms. Major structures like buildings, bridges, dams are 
subjected to severe loading and their performance is likely to change with time. It is, 
therefore, necessary to check the performance of a structure through continuous monitoring. 
If performance deviates from the design parameters, appropriate maintenance is required. 
The life of a structure depends on initial strength and the post construction maintenance. It 
is for this reason that the necessity of structural health monitoring (SHM) is emphasized 
worldwide. There are several techniques to monitor the health of structures. These can be 
divided broadly into two types, global and local.  
This paper presents a system that can be used to measure or detect the parameter such 
as vibration, deflection etc. in order to monitors the health of structural elements such 
as beam. Such rapid and reliable detection of impairments enables the development of 
better risk management strategies to prevent casualties in case of earthquake and floods. 
There are different types of sensors which can be used for SHM. In general, the performance 
of PZT sensor is better than other sensors and is also very cost effective. In this study, PZT 
knock have been used as sensors for both global and local level damages. PZT knock 
sensor is made up of ceramic material which has been used to detect the vibration. A 
simple low-cost experimental technique has been developed to detect the physical 
parameter and the value obtained from sensor output has been verified with theoretical one. 
A case study has been done on the steel beam in the laboratory.
